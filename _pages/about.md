My interests emerge when **optics & photonics** meet with **nonlinear dynamics & complex systems**, especially when it is also related to **quantum science & technology**. Some of the topics are listed below: 

<ul>
    <li>Lasers and mode-locking (laser is a fascinating platform showing emblematic emergent phenomena and it is also very useful in science and engineering)</li>
    <li>Optical frequency combs and optical solitons, e.g. in fibers and microresonators</li>
    <li>Attosecond physics and light-matter interaction</li>
    <li>Optomechanics</li>
    <li>Quantum light sources</li>
    <li>Topological photonics</li>
</ul>




I want to understand the complex structures and dynamics of nonlinear photonic systems, then find ways to control them, and finally make use of them.
