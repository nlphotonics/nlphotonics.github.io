My interests emerge when optics and photonics meet with nonlinear dynamics and complex systems. Some of the topics are listed below: 

<ul>
    <li>Lasers and mode-locking (laser is a fascinating platform showing emblematic emergent phenomena and it is also very useful in science and engineering)</li>
    <li>Optical frequency combs and optical solitons, e.g. in fibers and microresonators</li>
    <li>Attosecond physics and light-matter interaction</li>
    <li>Non-Hermitian and PT-symmetric systems in photonics (the balance of gain and loss makes me think of dissipative solitons)</li>
    <li>Topological photonics (I have a feeling that there is some robustness related to the topological things, and it often shows up with beautiful figures!)</li>
</ul>



I want to understand the complex structures and dynamics of nonlinear photonic systems, then find ways to control them, and finally make use of them.
