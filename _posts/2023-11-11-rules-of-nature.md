We live in a society based on many established rules. These rules are made by human and sometimes can be changed by human. The nature we live in is also governed by rules, for example, laws of physics. Therefore, we may ask a similar question: Can we change the rules of nature? 

The answer is a definite no. Imagine we could change the rules of nature, for example, one day, we had some methods to make the gravitational constant 10 times larger between some masses. Then the fact that we could change the rule is also a rule of nature, just because we are a part of nature. Actually, the rule we thought we could change is just a subset (or limit) of a more general rule. We did not change that rule, we just discovered a more general and complete rule. 

This gives some eternity to the laws (rules) of nature. And also, this gives me some satisfaction, because the laws I learn, and, maybe someday, discover, will not be overthrown by someone else. I’m not saying that I will never be wrong. I’m saying that the legitimacy of the existence of the laws is not determined by some powerful people. The only one that can judge us is the nature itself.
